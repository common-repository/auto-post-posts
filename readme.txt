Auto Post Posts is a plugin that automatically posts your drafted posts.

== Description ==

APP (Auto Post Posts) enables you to automatically post your drafted wordpress posts.
It works this way;
Whenever a user enters your website, the plugins check to see if it should publish a new drafted post.
If a number of seconds have passed since the plugin last published a post, it will publish a new one.
Once it publish a post, it will set a flag in the database that it published a post NOW, and the timer starts over.

Simply download, activate and go to Settings -> Auto Post Posts and fix the settings!
